In order to use PHLib with MATLAB You need to have a MATLAB version that supports 
the 'calllib' function. 
Be very careful about the header file name specified in 'loadlibrary'. This name 
is case sensitive and a wrong spelling will lead to an apparently successful load 
but later no library calls will work.
