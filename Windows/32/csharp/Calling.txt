and correct type specification of the parameters. Not all types are easily 
portable. Especially C strings require special handling. Here we used the C# 
helper StringBuilder. Similar difficulties arise with structs, however, 
THLib does not use structs in calling parameters. 

The C# demos are portable between platforms, e.g. Windows and Linux, however, 
this requires that you  stick to the subset of .NET that is supported by all 
platforms. It also requires that you have the native DLL for the platform you 
are targeting. 

Currently we only support Windows and Linux on x86 (32 bits). Because of the
native code dependencies, your main assembly will need to specify the same 
bit-ness as the native DLL, which is 32 bits. Therfore, in your project 
settings you need to select x86. The resulting programs will still run on 
64 bit systems but only as 32 bit code.
