In order to use PHLib with MATLAB You need to have a MATLAB version that supports 
the 'calllib' function. We have tested with MATLAB 7.3 but any version from 6.5 
should work. 
Be very careful about the header file name specified in 'loadlibrary'. This name 
is case sensitive and a wrong spelling will lead to an apparently successful load 
but later no library calls will work.
